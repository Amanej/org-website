# Snakke om JAMstack #3

This is issue 3 of the meeting notes for the [JAMstack Oslo][7] organization.
It focuses on keeping anyone interested in [JAMstack Oslo][7] up to date.
Written by Alexander Alemayhu. 

---

Aman Mender and I did the first JAMstack Oslo conference call on the [Discord server][0].
As usual with streaming software we started of with some issues, but they were
quickly resolved by [Push-to-Talk][1].

The topics for today were

## Thoughts on the upcoming Meetup

We discussed the Meetup text which looks good. Aman suggested creating a
checklist template for common repeated tasks. I will look into this and have a
backup topic in the unlikely case the speaker can't make it.

I will try to follow up on slides and post stream / video links to the Meetup
page.  Byteconf will be streaming it on their [Twitch channel][2].

## GitHub organization

We created a new [GitHub organization][5] for the [Meetup][3]. This will be a
place to host [the organization website][4] and related pages / apps.

## What's next?

Since January is now fully planned we got to move on to the potential speakers
for March and February. No spoilers in here, see [Meetup][3] or [Discord][0] ;)
Aman has already someone in mind and will invite them soon.  It's still early
but we have someone in mind for March and I will follow up.

## Misc

At the end we discussed possible ways to reach more people.  We will try
different approaches on reaching out to potential speakers.  If you have
someone in mind or would like to present in any of the available slots for
2019, feel free to suggest on [Discord][0], [email][8], [Meetup][3] or the next
conference call on the 5th February (7PM - 8PM).

If you are interested in helping organizing please reach out. In any of the
above mentioned places. See you hopefully on the next meetup.
