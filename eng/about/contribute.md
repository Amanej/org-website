# Contribute

We are very happy that you are interested in contributing and welcome you :smile:

JAMstack Oslo is run on a volunteer basis so we are dependent on volunteers to
get things done. We are actively seeking new people to join the organization
team.

If you can't commit longterm there are also other places we need help
[You could speak](/events/speaking.html), [fix typos / broken links on this site](https://github.com/JAMstack-Oslo/org-website) or
make waffles :)

Please reach out via one of the preferred ways listed on the [contact page](/about/contact.html).
