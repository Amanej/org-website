# JAMstack Oslo

JAMstack Oslo is a group for anyone interested in Javascript, static site
generation, markup, git based deployments. If you are a web developer
unfamiliar with git but wanting to move away from FTP, this is also for you!

The goal of this [meetup][2] is to nurture and grow a Oslo chapter of the
[JAMstack meetup][3]. If you would like to help out, please see ways you can do
that [below][#contribute].

## Contribute

We are very happy that you are interested in contributing and welcome you :smile:
JAMstack Oslo is run on a volunteer basis so we are dependent on volunteers to
get things done. We are actively seeking new people to join the organization
team. If you are interested please [reach out](#ways-to-reach-out).

### Inviting speakers

If you have suggestions for topics or people who we should invite, please share
them with us. We are actively looking for new people to join the organization
team. If you want to invite someone, see [Topics for 2019](#topics-for-2019).

### Less structure

While the primary event will be the monthly talks we encourage members of the
meetup group to organize other types of events like JAMstack social where the
environment could be f. ex. in a bar or a coffee shop and overall more
spontaneous.  These types are much more flexible and you can freely pick the
date and time. Know of a good place to for this or do you want to organize
this?  [Let us know about it][0] :smile:.


### Giving feedback

We want to make this event excellent and improve it wherever possible. If you
have time [tell us][#ways-to-reach-out] what you like and what can be improved,
thanks.

### Sponsoring

Fortunately thanks to the kind people at [Sanity][4], we don't have high
operational cost, but if you would like to provide catering or sponsor a social
evening, we might be interested. Also If you have some swag like t-shirts,
books, etc. you want to give attendees, [tell us](#ways-to-reach-out) about it.

#### Topics for 2019

Below is list of the dates for today. Event pages with `ðŸ‘€` means no-one has
started looking or suggested a speaker / topic yet. `ðŸ”œ` means we are planning
to establish dialog or have invited someone. Don't feel discouraged if a date
is marked `ðŸ”œ` and you want to present then. Until a event link is added below
you can consider the date as available. Please join our [Discord][0] to
coordinate.
