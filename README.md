# Welcome to the JAMstack Oslo Community

JAMstack Oslo is a group for anyone interested in Javascript, static site
generation, markup, git based deployments. If you are a web developer
unfamiliar with git but wanting to move away from FTP, this is also for you!

The intention of this [meetup][2] is to nurture and grow a Oslo chapter of the
[JAMstack meetup][3]. If you would like to help out, please see ways you can do
that [below](#contribute).

## Contribute

We are very happy that you are interested in contributing and welcome you :smile:

JAMstack Oslo is run on a volunteer basis so we are dependent on volunteers to
get things done. We are actively seeking new people to join the organization
team. If you are interested please [reach out](#ways-to-reach-out).

### Inviting speakers

If you have suggestions for topics or people who we should invite, please
[share them with us](#ways-to-reach-out).  If you want to invite someone, see
[Topics for 2019](#topics-for-2019).

### Formats

While the main event will be the monthly talks, nothing is set in stone and the
community can shape the events. If you would like to do a lightning talk, host
a social gathering, [join us](#ways-to-reach-out).

### Giving feedback

We want to make this event excellent and improve it wherever possible. If you
have time [tell us](#ways-to-reach-out) what you like and what can be improved,
thanks.

### Sponsoring

Fortunately thanks to the kind people at [Sanity][4], we don't have high
operational cost, but if you would like to provide catering or sponsor a social
evening, we might be interested. Also If you have some swag like t-shirts,
books, etc. you want to give attendees, [tell us](#ways-to-reach-out) about it.

#### Topics for 2019

Below is list of the dates for this year. Event pages with `ðŸ‘€` means no-one has
started looking or suggested a speaker / topic yet. `ðŸ”œ` means we are planning
to establish dialog or have invited someone. Don't feel discouraged if a date
is marked `ðŸ”œ` and you want to present then. Until a event link is added below
you can consider the date as available. Please join our [Discord][0] to
coordinate and read the [Checklist for inviting speaker][7].

## Ways to reach out

There are several avenues to getting in touch.  We try to be very accessible
and someone is usually checking the [Discord][0] server frequently. 

### In person

Physical planning meetings are scheduled on demand. If you prefer in person
then attending the next meetup might be better, see [Meetup.com][2] for dates.

### Monthly conference calls

You can attend the community conference call on the 5th every month from 7PM to
8PM in the [#monthly-planning][0] channel on [Discord][0]. For a full overview
on the dates see the [calendar][1].

If you are new to Discord or use the website, please [download][5] the desktop
or mobile app beforehand to avoid any audio issues. Thanks!

### Chat

As mentioned above we a have a [Discord][0] server setup for real-time
interactions. We have a chat channel [#planning][8] which is the coordination
point for inviting speakers. We share notes and progress in there. If you like
to stay up to date then this is the right place for you.

### Misc

If you are old school then feel free to reach out on [Email](mailto:alexander@alemayhu.com?subject=JAMstack-Oslo).

If you prefer GitHub issues you can open up one [here](https://github.com/JAMstack-Oslo/org-website/issues).

## Notes from previous meetings

Alexander Alemayhu tries to write summaries from the planning meetings to keep
the community up to date. If you are interested in writing notes for any of the
meetings, just do it! Feel free to show your interest on [Discord][0] or open up
a pull request on [JAMstack-Oslo/org-website][6].
