# JAMstack Oslo

If you have suggestions for topics or people who we should invite, please share
them with us.  We are actively looking for new people to join the organization
team.  If you are interested, please reach out.  We are also very receptive to
feedback and value it. Tell us what you like and what can be improved, thanks.

## Ways to reach out

### In person

Physical planning meetings are scheduled on demand.  If you prefer in person
then attending the next meetup might be better, see [Meetup.com][2] for dates.

### Monthly conference calls

You can attend the community conference call on the 5th every month from 7PM to
8PM in the [#monthly-planning][0] channel on [Discord][0].  For a full overview
on the dates see the [calendar][1].

### Chat

We a have a [Discord][0] server setup for real-time interactions. It's like
Slack but better :wink: Another reason to join is all of the notes on the
upcoming events are recorded there.

### Misc

If you are old school then feel free to reach out on [Email](mailto:alexander@alemayhu.com?subject=JAMstack-Oslo).

If you prefer issues you can open up one [here](https://github.com/JAMstack-Oslo/org-website/issues).
