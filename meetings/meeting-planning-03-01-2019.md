I visited the [Sanity.io][8] office today. The location is great and not far
from work or my home.  We talked about the following items:

## Sanity venue

Shortly after entering the venue, I was kindly greeted. Knut gave me a tour and
introduced me to some of his collegaues.

I gave Knut a short summary on my background and the motivation for organizing.
He also shared some of his past.  I appreciated his honesty on the reasoning
for wanting to be a part of the group. Sanity is already using a lot of the
tooling and they are familiar with the Netlify people so supporting us by
hosting in their venue makes good business sense. Assuming we don’t show up
everyday and try to move in :wink:

Anyways, they are very open to presenting but would like to remain a neutral
host so the community is in charge of the program.

## Recording and live streams

There was a lot of equipment in there and recording all talks should be possible.
In the unlikely case we should need a disco ball, they have it.

Knut has already contacted the people at Byteconf regarding live streaming on
Twitch. It would awesome to get this for all the talks :grin:

## Speaker line up

We also briefly talked about the possible speakers / topics for February and
March. Of course no spoilers, check [Meetup][7] early each month :wink:

It’s still early but we would love to collaborate with the Netlify people.
They might help us reach more interested people in Europe or those who intend
to travel here. Getting our page on the [JAMstack.org][11] website would
be awesome but we can revisit all this after hosting a few events.

## Remote speakers

We talked about event types. See the meeting notes for [Snakke om JAMstack #1][0] for details.
Knut had the great idea of trying out, remote presentations. I like it and we
should definitely try this!


## Kode24

The magazine at [kode24][kode24] published a article today about their [coding
calender][9].  Knut will establish a dialogue with them.


## Building a organization team

I emphasized my dreams on collaborating with other people to get the meetup in
a healthy shape.  We are still in the early phases but we will always keep
looking out for others who want to help organize or are taking initiative.  If
you are interested, please feel free to reach out on [Discord][1], attend
planning [meetings][2] or [email][3].

The next conference call is this Saturday from 7PM to 8PM in the [#monthly-planning][10].

## Which companies in Norway use Netlify?

This was an idea originally from Aman and I made a npm module [isun][4] which
just checks the HTTP headers for a Netlify related string. The plan is to use
this to build a website that reads company data from [Brønnøysundregistrene][5]
so we can find more companies we can invite to talk. We already have a good
list of potentials but it won't hurt to grow it.

## January Meetup

We also talked about the format of the upcoming meetup. We need to update the
event page with the speaker, talk and location. I will send Knut a suggestion.
He will polish and fill in the blanks if not rewrite it :smile:

## Misc

We also talked about the issue of incremental builds when using Netlify.
Hopefully someone from the community will be talking about this in the future.

Thank you for reading this. I hope to see you [later this month][6].
