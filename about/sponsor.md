# Sponsor & Support

We welcome any kind of support from the community. The Meetup is volunteer driven so there are many
ways to help out. This could be on the organization side of things, or accomodating speakers who have
to travel via a budget for the travel cost / lodging. If this sounds interesting, please [reach out][c].

Fortunately thanks to the kind people at [Sanity][4] lending us their venue, we don't have high
operational cost, but if you would like to provide catering or sponsor a social
evening, we might be interested. Also If you have some swag like t-shirts,
books, etc. you want to give attendees, [tell us][c] about it.
